# TSA-Seq data smoothing
This code is used to smooth 20kb-binned TSA-Seq .wig data 

```shell
TSA_smooth_hanningFor20kbNonsliding_TSA2.0.py python --wig TSA-Seq_20kb.wig -w 20000 -aggwin 200000 --smooth -n1 TSA-Seq_hanning_20kbx21 -n2 TSA-Seq_hanning_20kbx21_agg_200kb -g utilities/hg38F.genome

# Genome size files (.genome) are in utilities, hg38F.genome was for female cell lines (K562), hg38M.genome was for male cell lines (H1, HCT116, HFFc6)

# Figures 2e (top), 2f (top), supplementary figures 10a (top), 10b (top), 11a (top), 11b (top) were generated by this code
